A program to allow the user to choose from various items within a pet shop, and add/remove these to their shopping cart
The program will display the users current items in their cart, and be able to print out everything in the cart;
as well as calculate the total cost.
This is my first portfolio task within my software engineering bootcamp with HyperionDev.

- Original Program - This was my first attempt at the portfolio near the very start of the course
- 2D List - I updated the original program to use 2D lists to store all the information related to each item ( name, quanity, price)
- Adding Functions and OOP - this will be my next update to the program, yet to be compelted.
